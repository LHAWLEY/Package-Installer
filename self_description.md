**Self Description**

**What does software craftsmanship mean to you?**

To me, software craftsmanship means continually growing and challenging yourself as a developer.  A craftsman is passionate about constantly pushing themselves to learn new technologies, and to create beautiful solutions to meaningful problems.  As a software engineer, this means refactoring solutions and thinking about problems from all different angles in an effort to create the best solutions.

**With which technologies are you comfortable?**

I am most comfortable with vanilla Javascript (ES6), React, JQuery, HTML, and CSS.  I do have working knowledge of Backbone, SQL, and Ruby.

**Which technologies are you currently learning?**

Since I currently work for a small startup with only 2 other developers, we are all constantly learning based on what our clients need and want.  Currently, I am learning Angular 2 and Ionic for a new client project, and personally, I am working through Node. Node experience has come up in many conversations, and I think it will help make me a more well-rounded Javascript developer.

**What are you doing to learn these technologies? Favorite learning resources?**

I like learning from a variety of resources.  Videos are a nice starting point for new languages because they are a little more hands-on.  As I develop a foundation, I find that reading really helps to solidify my understanding of terminology and concepts.

**Which technical communities do you actively participate in?**

Chicago has a really robust tech community.  There are so many opportunities to do hackathons, mentoring, and meetups.  I have done a little bit of all of them.  My favorite activity to participate in is mentoring: I mentor students at DBC and through Coder Dojo Chi.  I also attend meetups that have a Javascript or Ruby focus.  I have participated in a handful of hackathons and really enjoy them because I get to work with new people and learn new ways of thinking through problems.
